This is a minimal example of problem I'm struggling with
(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65953896/opengl-canvas-if-flickering-in-jframe-on-a-windows-platform)
For some reason canvas is flickering like hell and I've no idea 
what can be done with it.

How to run:
`./gradlew run`
or
`.\gradlew.bat run`
